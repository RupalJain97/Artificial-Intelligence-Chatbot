                        A <strong><span id="head">Career</strong></span> is an individual's journey through learning, work and other aspects of life. Career is a very important aspect of anyone's life. Choosing a career in a certain stream defines the
                        future of a student. However, it is difficult for a student to choose a career path at the early age.

                        <p>
                            The world of work is changing all the time and fast. Jobs have emerged that didn't exist five or ten years ago. And the idea that you'd stick with one career for your entire working life has been left in the dust.

                        <p>
                            Choosing a career in a particular stream or profession right at the beginning has a long lasting impact on a student's future. It is very important for any student to choose carefully from various options available to him or her with respect to his or
                            her interest. In order to achieve success, one has to select the path which they like to walk on. Good judgment and right kind of aptitude coupled with guidance in the right direction to pick up a definite stream helps one
                            in choosing the right career option. So from the very beginning a student should be careful in making choice of their stream.
